I created this repo as a small reproduction codebase to help me understand how one could import ESM modules from inside a CommonJS project.

To run the code, run `npm run build-run`. This builds the code in the `/src` directory and then runs `node build/index.js`.

This is useful: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module
